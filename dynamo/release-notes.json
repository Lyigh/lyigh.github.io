I'm so excited that the day is finally here! 2.4, which started development over a month ago (sigh), has gone through several evolutions to become what it is today.\n Although this could be considered a full-sized release, I am still calling this a pre-version to 3.0, in which this pack is building towards. Anyways, this update commits to a great deal of changes that I hope will provide you a more unique and engaging Minecraft experience. Reading through the provided sections will give you a great advantage, but it's up to you."
